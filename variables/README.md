#PHP
PHP is a Loosely Typed Language.PHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value. Since the data types are not set in a strict sense, you can do things like adding a string to an integer without causing an error.

String
Integer
Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
Boolean
Array
Object
NULL
Resource
